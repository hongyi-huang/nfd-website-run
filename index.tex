\chapter*{Overview}

NFV ecosystem is flourishing and more and more NF platforms appear, but this makes NF vendors difficult to deliver NFs rapidly to diverse platforms. 

\textbf{NFD} (Network Function Development) issues a novel development framework to address cross-platform development problems. NFD mainly includes a \textbf{\emph{platform-independent language}} to program NFsâ€™ behavior models, and a \textbf{\emph{compiler}} with interfaces to develop platform-specific plugins. 

Moreover, NF development using our model-based method can greatly facilitate logic optimizations(\textbf{NFReducer}) and verifications(\textbf{NF-SE}) as well.

We have open source NF models and codes in \href{https://github.com/openNFD/NFD}{openNFD}. NFD is also released on \href{https://github.com/sdnfv/openNetVM/tree/master/examples/NFD}{OpenNetVM}.
