## Overview 

NFV ecosystem is flourishing and more and more NF platforms appear, but this makes NF vendors difficult to deliver NFs rapidly to diverse platforms. 

**NFD** (Network Function Development) issues a novel development framework to address cross-platform development problems. NFD mainly includes a ***platform-independent language*** to program NFsâ€™ behavior models, and a ***compiler*** with interfaces to develop platform-specific plugins. 

Moreover, NF development using our model-based method can greatly facilitate logic optimizations(**NFReducer**) and verifications(**NF-SE**) as well.


We have open source NF models and codes in [openNFD](https://github.com/openNFD/NFD). NFD is also released on [OpenNetVM](https://github.com/sdnfv/openNetVM/tree/master/examples/NFD).
